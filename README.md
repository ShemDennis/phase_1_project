## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical aircraft incident data to identify trends and provide recommendations for improving aircraft safety. By examining various factors such as aircraft models, engine types, injury severity, and weather conditions, the project seeks to help fleet managers make informed decisions on aircraft selection and operations. The analysis also explores the differences between amateur-built and professional aircraft, highlighting the risks associated with both categories.

The ultimate goal is to contribute to safer aviation practices by providing data-driven insights and recommendations.

## Data

The dataset includes key fields that represent critical aspects of aircraft incidents. Each dataset has been cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accurate results.

- **Aircraft Models**: This dataset includes the specific models of aircraft involved in incidents, such as Cessna 152, Boeing 737, and others. Understanding which models are more prone to incidents is key to informing safer fleet choices.

- **Engine Types**: This dataset categorizes the engine types involved in the incidents, such as Turbo Prop and Turbo Shaft engines. It helps in identifying which engine types are associated with higher or lower safety risks.

- **Injury Severity**: This dataset captures the severity of injuries resulting from aircraft incidents, classified into categories such as Minor, Serious, and Fatal. Injury severity is a key metric for evaluating the overall impact of an incident.

- **Weather Conditions**: This dataset highlights the weather conditions at the time of each incident, such as Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). This helps in analyzing the role of weather in aircraft safety.

## Results

Through analyzing these datasets, several key findings were uncovered:

- **High-risk models**: Certain models, such as the Cessna 152 and Boeing 737, have shown a higher incidence rate in the dataset. These models may require closer scrutiny or enhanced safety measures to mitigate risks.
  
- **Recommended models**: Safer models, including the Cessna C208B and C207, consistently performed better in terms of safety metrics. These models are recommended for operators seeking safer fleet options.
  
- **Safer engine types**: Turbo Prop and Turbo Shaft engines were identified as more reliable in terms of safety performance when compared to other engine types. Operators are encouraged to consider these engines for better safety outcomes.

- **Weather impact**: Incidents that occurred under IMC conditions showed a higher rate of fatalities. This finding underscores the need for improved pilot training and better preparation for flights in challenging weather conditions.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to improve aircraft safety and fleet management:

- **Prioritize models like Cessna C208B**: Given the lower incident rate of models like the Cessna C208B, operators should consider prioritizing these models in their fleet.

- **Choose aircraft with Turbo Prop engines**: Turbo Prop engines have been shown to have superior safety records. Operators should opt for aircraft equipped with these engines where possible.

- **Improve pilot training for poor weather conditions**: Since incidents under IMC conditions tend to be more severe, airlines and private operators should invest in advanced pilot training that focuses on handling adverse weather scenarios.

- **Limit the use of amateur-built aircraft**: Amateur-built aircraft have a higher incidence rate compared to professionally built aircraft. Where possible, operators should limit the use of amateur-built aircraft, especially for commercial purposes.

## Visualizations

To help communicate the findings and recommendations effectively, the following visual resources are available:

- **Pptx Presentation**: This presentation provides a summary of the analysis, key insights, and recommendations. It can be used for stakeholder briefings or educational purposes.  
  [Download the presentation](https://github.com/ShemDennis/phase_1_project/blob/main/project%20presentation.pptx)

- **Tableau Dashboard**: An interactive Tableau dashboard allows users to explore the data and insights in more depth. The dashboard provides a visual representation of incident patterns, risk models, engine performance, and more.

## Future Work

There is scope for further research in several areas:
- **Expanding the dataset** to include more recent incidents and broader geographic regions.
- **In-depth analysis of pilot experience** as a variable in incident outcomes.
- **Developing predictive models** to forecast high-risk conditions based on weather, aircraft type, and other factors.
